# ninja_bird
This is a video made for fun to practice pygame. It only uses the space bar to fly your bird. When you press the space bar it goes up and then it falls by gravity. Eat as many mosquitoes as you can while avoiding crashing with the flyiing bricks. The bricks will fly faster and faster as you advance in the game. Crashing against the bricks makes you loose live. You can recover life eating mosquitoes. When all your life is gone the game is over.
 A video with a demo of the game can be found in:
